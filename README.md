## 0:00 Introductions, goals, safe place

Welcome. I'm _____. My goal is to make this a safe place for us to learn about balancing power imbalances in pairing. < (Optional) Tell a story about how you became excited about pair programming. > I'm not an expert. I'm still growing in my ability to pair.

Goals:
* We will be deeply listening to engineers' experiences in pairing.  

Anti-goals:
* We will not be covering the pros and cons of pairing. This workshop assumes that you already know the benefits of pairing. 
* We are not here to practice pairing.
* We are not here to practice giving and receiving feedback.

## Ground Rules

- Be present 
- Take off our hats
- Speak from the “I” perspective
- Listen with the intent of being changed by what you hear 
- Discussion is private and non-attributable

## Instructions
We are going to hear experiences about pair programming. We will have time to listen, reflect, and discuss these stories.

Some are short, some are long. Although personal pronouns are used in the stories, we’ve heard many of these stories across gender identities. 

We will have a narrator read the story out loud, and then pause for a moment of reflection and journalling.   We'll be silent during this part of the workshop. For each story, you will "Write down one thing you learned from this passage."

We'll pass the stories around the room clockwise. If you'd prefer not to narrate, simply hand the stories to the next person. When you are done reading please give the room a chance to write down their thoughts before handing the stories to the next person. We'll let you be the judge of how long to wait. There is no perfect timing, let the room have a chance to absorb and process the story. Silence is ok.

After we've read and reflected on all the stories, we'll have time for discussion and dialogue later. 

Any questions?

## Reading the stories

< Hand the stories to the first person. >

## Groups of 4 Debrief

We will break into groups of four to discuss each story. During discussion and dialogue, we'd like to process what we just heard.

If you have experienced these situations, you may need time to sort through your experience. You can choose how much to share. We want this to be a safe place where we are listening without judgement.

## Entire room Debrief

* We’ll convene all together to discuss what we've learned. Let's have people share in any order that they feel like. We'll do "popcorn" style, not a "round robin")

* If you feel like sharing, did you see yourself in any of these stories? How did that make you feel?  

* Have you ever experienced Story #8?

* What is one thing you plan to do differently moving forward?

* Thank you for attending. I'll now collect the pairing stories.

## (Optional) Collect feedback

< I like collecting feedback. > Hand out the workshop feedback forms.

* What is something that you liked about the workshop?
* What would you change in the workshop?
* Would you recommend this presentation for another _______ office? Why?
